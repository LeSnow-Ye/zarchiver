# Scraping notes

These are the findings that justify zarchiver's scraping design. They were
verified against live Zhihu during development.

## Plain HTTP doesn't work

Requests from `curl`, `requests`, or `httpx` get **HTTP 403** on question pages,
column articles, and the `api/v4/*` endpoints. The JSON API additionally
requires a signed `x-zse-96` header (it returns `code 10003` without it).
Reverse-engineering that signature is brittle and a moving target, so zarchiver
does not attempt it.

**Conclusion:** drive a real browser.

## Headless is detected — run headful

Playwright's default `headless=True` uses `chrome-headless-shell`, which Zhihu
detects and blocks (`code 40362`, "请求存在异常"). Launching **headful**
Chromium with light anti-detection tweaks loads pages normally.

zarchiver therefore defaults `browser.headless = false` and applies:

- launch args `--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled`, `--no-sandbox`
- an init script masking `navigator.webdriver`, setting `navigator.languages`,
  and faking `window.chrome` / `navigator.plugins`

On a desktop or WSL2 (via WSLg) this just works. On a true headless server, run
under `xvfb-run` and supply cookies via `ZHIHU_COOKIE`.

## The 403-then-hydrate quirk

Even on a successful headful load, the **top-level navigation response status is
often 403** — Zhihu's edge returns a 403 document and then the page hydrates
with real content. So zarchiver does **not** treat the navigation status as a
failure signal. Instead it waits for the embedded data script and checks for
actual content.

## Parse `js-initialData`, don't scrape the DOM

Every Zhihu page embeds a complete JSON state document in
`<script id="js-initialData">`. Parsing
`JSON.parse(...).initialState.entities` gives clean, stable entities:

- `entities.articles[id]` — `title`, `content` (HTML), `author`, `created`,
  `updated`, `voteupCount`, `commentCount`, `excerpt`, `column`, `topics`
- `entities.answers[id]` — same shape plus `question`
- `entities.questions[id]` — question metadata

This is far more robust than scraping rendered DOM (class names change often).
zarchiver only falls back to DOM parsing when the embedded data is missing.

Timestamps are unix epoch seconds. Content is raw HTML using `data-pid`
paragraphs, `pic*.zhimg.com` images (lazy-loaded via `data-original` /
`data-actualsrc`), and `link.zhihu.com/?target=...` redirect links — all
normalized in `parser.clean_content_html`.

## Batch pages lazy-load

On question and collection pages, answer cards are lazy-loaded and don't always
expose a clean `<a href>` to each item. zarchiver harvests candidate item URLs
from three signals while scrolling:

1. plain `<a href>` anchors,
2. `meta[itemprop="url"]` tags,
3. answer ids on `.AnswerItem[data-zop]`, reconstructed into answer URLs.

It scrolls until no new links appear (or the configured cap is reached), then
visits each item.

## Images and referer

`pic*.zhimg.com` checks the `Referer` header, so the image downloader sends
`Referer: https://www.zhihu.com/` with a browser-like user agent. Filenames are
content-hash based and the extension is sniffed from magic bytes when the URL
lacks one.

## Politeness

Batch runs sleep a randomized `min_delay_ms`–`max_delay_ms` between items to
avoid hammering Zhihu. Keep this enabled and archive responsibly: only content
you have access to, for personal archival.
